# ChatBotSolutions React App

## About

I developed this project as a part of the 'Build AI Apps with CHATGPT, DALL-E, and GPT-4' initiative. The app is build with REACT,  OpenAI for the api calls and Spline for the interactive  3D objects.  The ChatBotSolutions React App represents a sophisticated web application that harnesses the power of AI technology to deliver an interactive customer service chatbot. This chatbot possesses the capability to actively engage with users, address their queries, and provide assistance across a range of inquiries. The core concept behind this application is to facilitate established businesses in submitting their historical customer service data for analysis. Subsequently, we employ this data to construct a tailored API endpoint. The chatbot then utilizes this endpoint, employing language that mirrors the communication style of actual customer service representatives. For a hands-on experience, users can access a demonstration through the 'DEMO' button, which showcases the chatbot's functionality based on example data. While the provided data is limited, resulting in non-optimal responses, it serves as a sufficient demonstration of the system's capabilities.

## Features

- AI-driven chatbot: The app uses AI technology to power the chatbot, making it capable of understanding and responding to user queries.
- Real-time conversation: Users can have real-time conversations with the chatbot to get the information they need.
- User-friendly interface: The app features a clean and intuitive user interface for a seamless user experience.
